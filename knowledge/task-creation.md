# Task Creation Standards

Creating clear, well-structured tasks is one of the most important parts of project management. A good task makes expectations obvious, removes ambiguity, and ensures work can move forward without unnecessary back-and-forth.

## Quick Start (For Simple Tasks)

Most people will occasionally need to make a task (PTO, internal meeting, etc.). You'll be fine if you:

1. Give a detailed task name/description so people understand what it's for
2. Set the proper due date, estimated time, and assign to the right person
3. Set Status to "Ready" when it's actually ready to be worked on

Simple tasks from non-AMs typically go in **Delivery > --General** folder—find the most appropriate list.

## Parent Tasks (Deliverables)

Parent tasks represent deliverables—the work a client would recognize as a completed outcome.

**Required elements:**
- Correct status (see status definitions)
- Due date reflecting when client expects the deliverable
- Budgeted month (if applicable)

**Guidelines:**
- Parent tasks should rarely have more than ~10 subtasks
- Beyond 10, split into multiple parent tasks for clarity
- For unique or cross-functional deliverables, sync with the team before setting to Ready

### Internal Meeting Tasks

When scheduling internal meetings:
- Create a task in the **Internal Meetings** list
- Set status to **Ready**
- Assign to the meeting facilitator
- Set **Estimated Time** to match meeting length

This keeps time tracking and capacity data accurate.

## Subtasks (Internal Steps)

Subtasks represent the internal steps that lead to completing the parent deliverable. They tell the story of how the work gets done.

**Each subtask must be:**
- Assigned to **one person**
- **Under four hours** of work (completable in one sitting)
- Supported by a strong spec (see Spec Framework)

**Each subtask should include:**
- Due date
- Time estimate
- Dependencies (optional but helpful for schedule flow)

### Review Steps

While AMs get assigned comments for review, subtasks typically include review steps to ensure nothing falls through. If multiple people are involved, that should be reflected as separate subtasks.

## The Spec Framework

A task or subtask shouldn't be assigned until it's properly specced. A strong spec answers four questions:

1. **Context**: What is the background for this task?
2. **Instructions**: What steps or approach should be taken?
3. **Resources**: What references, files, or links are needed?
4. **Expected Output**: What does "done" look like?

The **Account Manager** is responsible for writing the spec before the task moves to "Ready." The definition may be in the description, comments, checklists, attachments, or relationships—as long as it's within the task.

**Note**: Descriptions cannot be unchecked when duplicating tasks. For tasks you plan to duplicate, add instance-specific info (file paths, references) to comments instead.

## When to Create New Parent Tasks

Create a new parent task instead of adding more subtasks when:
- You have more than 10 subtasks
- The scope has expanded significantly
- A logical deliverable boundary exists

## Handling Dependencies

- **Between subtasks**: Use ClickUp dependencies to show sequence
- **Between parent tasks**: Use due dates to show sequence (avoid parent-level dependencies—they get messy)

## Emergency Same-Day Tasks

When you need something done today but capacity is full:

1. Is there anyone else who can do this task with capacity?
2. Can you move other work for your clients to make room?
3. Is this REALLY an emergency, or does it just feel like one?
4. Are other AMs willing to move something out?

It's your responsibility to notify the assignee and adjust other work accordingly.
