# Task Management

In an ideal world, tasks are created, specified, assigned, and completed exactly as planned. We don't live in an ideal world.

Throughout a task's lifespan, adjustments will be needed. This page outlines key adjustment scenarios.

## Managing Client Edits

Whether a parent task should include steps for client review depends on client context and what's expected. If a client always wants edits, include a subtask for that.

**Best practice**: Err on the side of adding a review step rather than scrambling to add one last minute.

**Important**: If a subtask is no longer needed (e.g., client edit step doesn't apply), **delete the subtask** rather than leaving it incomplete or marking "Done." This keeps timelines, reporting, and workload data clean.

## Who Can Adjust Tasks?

**Non-Account Managers** should not move task assignees, due dates, etc. If something needs adjusting, ask the Account Manager (found by navigating to the task's folder). AMs are responsible for timeline management and need to know everything happening.

## When a "Done" Task Needs More Work

When a task marked Done needs additional work, AMs have three options:

### Option 1: Just Adjust It Yourself
Some adjustments are quick and easy. If it takes less than 10 minutes, it's generally faster to do it yourself. Let the assignee know what should have been done if helpful.

### Option 2: Send Back to Assignee
Use when a task wasn't completed per spec:
- Move status back to Ready
- Assign a comment to the individual
- This should be their highest priority—the task should have been done already
- **Don't change the due date**—the work was already scheduled

### Option 3: Create a New Subtask
Use when context has changed or new ideas require a different direction:
- The original assignee didn't do anything wrong
- Create a new subtask scheduled appropriately
- This acknowledges new scope rather than implying incomplete work

## Adjusting Timelines

When timelines need to shift:
- Update due dates proactively—don't let tasks go overdue
- Communicate changes to affected parties
- Consider downstream dependencies
- Update time estimates if scope changed

## Handling Blocked Tasks

### Internal Blocked
1. Move subtask to Internal Blocked
2. Assign comment to AM with blocker details
3. AM resolves the issue
4. Return to Ready once resolved

### Waiting on Client
1. Move subtask to Waiting on Client
2. Move parent task to Waiting on Client too
3. Set due date to best guess of when client will respond
4. Communicate timeline expectations to client
5. Pull up due dates if client responds faster than expected

## Capacity Management

When workload exceeds capacity:
- Earlier-scheduled tasks get priority (First Come, First Serve principle)
- Later-added tasks get pushed by default
- Communicate with AMs if their work is affected
- Consider reassigning to team members with capacity
