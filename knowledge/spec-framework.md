# The Spec Framework

A task or subtask shouldn't be written or assigned until it's properly specced. To "spec" a task means to make it fully clear and actionable before it's handed off.

## The Four Questions

A strong spec answers these four questions:

### 1. Context
**What is the background for this task?**

Provide the "why" behind the work:
- What prompted this task?
- How does it fit into the larger project or client relationship?
- Any relevant history or previous decisions?

**Examples**:
- "Client is launching a new product line in Q2 and needs landing page support"
- "This is the monthly newsletter—same format as previous months"
- "Follow-up from client meeting where they requested homepage updates"

### 2. Instructions
**What steps or approach should be taken?**

Provide clear direction on execution:
- Specific steps to follow
- Technical requirements or constraints
- Approach or methodology to use
- What NOT to do (if relevant)

**Examples**:
- "Use the existing brand guidelines doc for colors and fonts"
- "Follow the same structure as the November newsletter"
- "Coordinate with design team before starting development"
- "Do NOT change the header—client approved that separately"

### 3. Resources
**What references, files, or links are needed?**

Provide everything needed to execute:
- Links to relevant documents
- File locations or attachments
- Access credentials (if appropriate)
- Related tasks or previous work to reference

**Examples**:
- "Brand guide: [link]"
- "Copy doc: [attached]"
- "Reference the homepage wireframe in task #12345"
- "Client's existing site: [URL]"

### 4. Expected Output
**What does "done" look like?**

Define the deliverable clearly:
- What specifically will be delivered?
- What format or state should it be in?
- Any quality criteria or acceptance standards?
- Where should the output be placed?

**Examples**:
- "Completed blog post in Google Doc, ready for AM review"
- "Deployed to staging site with all functionality working"
- "3 social post variations with images sized for each platform"
- "PDF report uploaded to client's shared drive folder"

## Where to Put the Spec

The spec can live in various places within the task:
- **Description**: Good for core context and instructions
- **Comments**: Good for instance-specific details (especially for duplicated tasks)
- **Checklists**: Good for step-by-step instructions
- **Attachments**: Good for reference files
- **Relationships**: Good for linking related tasks

**Important Note**: Descriptions cannot be unchecked when duplicating tasks. For recurring tasks you'll duplicate, put instance-specific information (file paths, this month's references, etc.) in comments instead.

## Spec Quality Checklist

Before moving a task to "Ready," verify:

- [ ] Could someone unfamiliar with this project execute it from the spec alone?
- [ ] Are all necessary resources linked or attached?
- [ ] Is the expected output specific and measurable?
- [ ] Are there any assumptions that should be made explicit?
- [ ] If this is a subtask, does it fit within 4 hours of work?

## When to Collaborate on Specs

For unique or cross-functional deliverables, sync with those responsible before setting to Ready:
- Confirms technical details and approach
- Validates time estimates
- Ensures everyone understands expected output
- Clarifies order of operations

**Rule of thumb**: If you're unsure about process, structure, or expected output, schedule a 15-20 minute sync before proceeding. A short meeting up front saves confusion later.

## Common Spec Failures

**Too vague**: "Update the website" → What pages? What changes? What's the expected result?

**Missing context**: Jumping straight to instructions without explaining why, leaving the assignee guessing at priorities.

**No expected output**: "Work on the newsletter" → Is it done when drafted? Designed? Sent? What state should it be in?

**Assumed knowledge**: Referencing things the assignee might not know about without providing links or explanation.

**Missing resources**: Instructions that require files or access that aren't provided or linked.
