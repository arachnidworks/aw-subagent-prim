# Core PM Principles

ClickUp is our project management system, but no system can predict every situation. These principles guide how we manage tasks, communicate as a team, and deliver work.

## The Seven Principles

### 1. No Time Travel
Tasks in "Ready" or "In Progress" should never be overdue. Adjust timelines as needed, but nothing should sit overdue when we are responsible for the task.

**Example**: If you click on "Home", there should be nothing overdue that's not Blocked in some way.

### 2. Due Date = Do Date
Unless otherwise noted, tasks should be completed on their due date, as other deliverables may depend on this timing. When the due date arrives for a Ready task, it should be fully specced out and ready to be executed.

**Example**: When the due date arrives, that task should be 100% completed that day. If you want to work ahead, check with the Account Manager.

### 3. Tasks Tell a Story
Parent tasks tell the client a story, while subtasks tell our team a story. Always ensure both reflect the true status of work.

**Example**: A client should be able to see all parent tasks and agree they reflect what we committed to. An internal team member should see exactly where their subtask fits and where it's headed.

### 4. Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast
Take your time in the speccing stage. Information will only entropy, so set a high bar of clarity at step one.

**Example**: 5 minutes spent on spec may save 50 minutes when it's not done right.

### 5. Keep It Manageable
Tasks should fit within an individual's daily workload (usually ~6-7 hours). Don't overload anyone or exceed their capacity. If a task takes more than 8 hours, it should be broken up.

**Example**: Check the team workload. Ask for time estimates from the person doing the work if you're unsure.

### 6. Templates Set the Trailmarkers, You Complete the Map
Templates provide a starting point, but every task is unique and requires thoughtful adjustments.

**Example**: If there's Lorem Ipsum in a task, this wasn't done properly.

### 7. First Come, First Serve
Schedule tasks in advance, as early scheduled tasks will take priority if capacity becomes limited. Good PM is rewarded.

**Example**: If a team member has 12 hours of work that day, the tasks added last will by default get pushed.

## Applying These Principles

When creating or managing tasks, ask yourself:
- Is this task overdue? If so, adjust it or escalate.
- Is the due date realistic and does everyone understand it's the completion date?
- Does this task clearly communicate what's expected to both client and team?
- Is the spec detailed enough to execute without questions?
- Does this fit within the assignee's capacity?
- Have I customized this beyond just copying a template?
- Am I scheduling this early enough to get priority?
